**PACO-LVIS: Parts and Attributes of Common Objects - Large Vocabulary Instance Segmentation** is a dataset for instance segmentation, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks. It is applicable or relevant across various domains. 

The dataset consists of 57643 images with 1644461 labeled objects belonging to 270 different classes including *body*, *rim*, *handle*, and other: *base*, *neck*, *side*, *inner_body*, *leg*, *bottom*, *back*, *strap*, *top*, *seat*, *wheel*, *inner_side*, *mirror*, *lid*, *bowl*, *blade*, *case*, *shoulder*, *pipe*, *screen*, *foot*, *button*, *cover*, *logo*, *bench*, and 242 more. There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train2017* (45790 images), *test2017* (9443 images), and *val2017* (2410 images). Also, the objects contains ***color***, ***pattern marking***, ***material***, ***transparency*** and ***part_of*** object tags. Explore them in the supervisely labeling tool. The dataset was released in 2023 by the Meta AI and Simon Fraser University, Canada.
